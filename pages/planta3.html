    Desalting is the first step of crude oil processing. Desalters are needed because petroleum contains salts that can cause corrosion in downstream units and cause unplanned outages. The salts of greatest concern are magnesium chloride (MgCl2), calcium chloride (CaCl2), and sodium chloride. Calcium and magnesium chloride will partially decompose (hydrolyze) in the hot preheat exchangers and heater. Upon hydrolysis, the chlorides from these salts convert into hydrogen chloride gas, which is absorbed into condensing water as hydrochloric acid in the upper part of a distillation tower or in overhead condensers. A well performing desalter can reach upwards of 90 % efficiency.
    Following the desalter, a system of heat exchangers (preheat) increase the oil temperature until it is almost fully vaporized. The heat is taken from other process streams that require cooling before being sent to rundown. Heat is also exchanged against condensing streams from the main tower. Somewhere in the preheat, a small, dilute caustic stream is often mixed with the crude to form sodium chloride from any hydrochloric acid formed by hydrolysis. The sodium chloride will exit the fractionation tower via the bottom residue stream. The dosing rate of caustic injection is adjusted to control chloride values in the overhead liquid accumulator, commonly to 10 ppm to 25 ppm.
    More heat is added with heat exchangers before entering the atmospheric furnace. Typically, the crude is heated up to 392 °F to 536 °F before entering a furnace.
    Atmospheric Furnace—The pre-heated crude enters the furnace and is heated to approximately 630 °F to 700 °F in the furnace. The furnace outlet stream is sent directly to the atmospheric crude tower where it is separated into products based on specification boiling ranges.
    Distillation is the second step of crude oil processing.
    Pre-flash Tower—Downstream of the desalter, somewhere in the pre-heat train before the atmospheric furnace, some refineries will operate a fractionator to remove gases which could increase pressure drop and wastefully absorb unnecessary heat.
    Atmospheric Tower—At approximately 630 °F to 700 °F and approximately 15 psig to 30 psig, most of the fractions in the crude oil vaporize and rise up the tower through perforations in the trays, losing heat as they rise. Each fraction condenses to a liquid phase when it reaches the tray just below its boiling point. A continuous liquid flows through “downcomers” from tray to tray and the different fractions are gradually separated from each other on the trays of the fractionation tower. The heaviest fractions condense on the lower trays and the lighterfractions condense on the trays higher up in the tower. At different elevations in the tower, fractions can be drawn out by gravity through pipes for further processing in the refinery.
    At the top of the tower, vapor enters an overhead condenser (a heat source for the preheat) then is further cooled by air fin-fans or heat exchangers (which are cooled by cooling towers) to 104 °F. Next, a mixture of gas and liquid naphtha falls into an overhead liquid accumulator. Gases are routed to a compressor for further recovery of LPG (C3/C4), while the liquid (naphtha) is pumped to a hydrotreater unit for sulfur removal.
    Side strippers are used to remove lighter hydrocarbons from product streams by using steam injection or a reboiler. The stripping steam rate or reboiler heat duty is controlled to meet the flash point specification of the product. Kerosene is often the lightest side draw from the atmospheric crude tower; boiling range of approximately 320 °F to 540 °F.
    The second and third (optional) side draw-offs from the main fractionating tower are gas-oil fractions, with a boiling range of approximately 400 °F to 750 °F, which are ultimately used for blending the final diesel product. Similar to the kerosene product, the gas-oil fractions (light and heavy gas oil) are first sent to a side stripper before being routed to further treating units.
    Sometimes called long residue, the atmospheric tower bottoms (ATB) is the heaviest fraction. In order to strip all light hydrocarbons from this fraction properly, the bottom section of the tower is equipped with a set of stripping trays, which are operated by injecting low pressure stripping steam (approximately 1 % to 3 % on ATB rate) into the bottom of the tower.
    Vacuum Distillation—To recover additional distillates from long residue, distillation at reduced pressure and high temperature has to be applied. The vacuum distillation process has become an important step in maximizing the upgrading of crude oil. As distillates, vacuum gas oil, lubricating oils or conversion feedstocks, or a combination thereof, are generally produced. The vacuum tower bottoms (VTB), sometimes called short residue, can be used as feedstock for further upgrading, as bitumen feedstock, or as a fuel component. The technology of vacuum distillation has developed considerably in recent decades. The main objectives have been to maximize the recovery of valuable distillates and to reduce the energy consumption of the units.
    Heated feed enters the vacuum tower at the flash zone, where the temperature should be high and pressure as low as possible to obtain maximum distillate yield. The flash zone and tower bottoms are typically operated at a maximum temperature of 790 °F and a low residence time to avoid cracking of heavy hydrocarbons.
    In the older type of high vacuum units, the required low hydrocarbon partial pressure in the flash zone could not be achieved without the use of “lifting” steam. The steam acts in a similar manner as the stripping steam of crude distillation units. These types of units are called “wet” units. One of the latest developments in vacuum distillation has been the deep vacuum flashers, in which no steam is required. These “dry” units operate at very low flash zone pressures and low pressure drops over the tower internals. For that reason, the conventional reflux sections with fractionation trays have been replaced by low pressure-drop spray sections. Cooled reflux is sprayed via a number of specially designed spray nozzles in the tower counter-current to the up-flowing vapor. This spray of small droplets comes into close contact with the hot vapor, resulting in good heat and mass transfer between the liquid and vapor phase.
    To achieve low energy consumption, heat from the circulating refluxes and rundown streams is used to heat up the long residue feed. Surplus heat is used to produce medium- or low-pressure steam or both; or is exported to another process unit (via heat integration). The direct fuel consumption of a modern high-vacuum unit is approximately 1 % on intake, depending on the quality of the feed. The steam consumption of the dry highvacuum units is significantly lower than that of the “wet” units. They have become net producers of steam instead of steam consumers.
    Three types of high-vacuum units for long residue upgrading have been developed for commercial application:
    1) Feed Preparation Units,
    2) Lube Oil High-Vacuum Units, and
    3) High-Vacuum Units for Bitumen Production.
    These units make a major contribution to deep conversion upgrading (“cutting deep in the barrel”). They produce distillate feedstocks for further upgrading in catalytic crackers, hydrocrackers, and thermal crackers. To obtain an optimum waxy distillate quality a wash oil section is installed between feed flash zone and waxy distillate drawoff.
    The wash oil produced is used as a fuel component or recycled to feed. The flashed residue (short residue) is cooled by heat exchange against long residue feed. A slipstream of this cooled short residue is returned to the bottom of the high-vacuum tower as quench to minimize cracking (maintain low bottom temperature.)
